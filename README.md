# Clinic-Management-System
A system in a Doctor's Clinic, where it keeps track of all patients as well as the medical history of each one with the medication prescribed for him. For each patient, you should save his name, address, date of birth, phone, and medical history. Each entry in the medical history should have the diagnosis, date of diagnosis, list of prescribed medication
